# MDE
## An IDE inside Minecraft 1.20.1

This is a fun little Spigot plugin for 1.20.1 that allows you to write and execute code inside Minecraft through chat. Made this in July 2023, thought I'd upload it now.

There are probably plenty of bugs/unimplemented features, but I wouldn't really advise anyone to use it anyway since players can just run code on your computer (or whichever one is hosting the server)

You have all rights to extend it and play around with the source code.

For those daring enough to try, copy the JAR file in `./out/artifacts/MDE_jar/` into your Spigot plugins folder.

### Run `/mde help` in-game to get started!
#### Note: I'm pretty sure running files only works on Windows, because of how the processes are created...
